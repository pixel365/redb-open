## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### **Phase 1: Single Maintainer (Current)**

During Phase 1 governance, security vulnerabilities should be reported directly to the maintainer:

#### **Primary Contact**
- **Maintainer**: @tommihip
- **Email**: [Maintainer email - to be added]
- **GitHub Issues**: Use the "Security" label

#### **Reporting Process**

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO** create a private security advisory or contact the maintainer directly
3. **DO** provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **DO** allow reasonable time for assessment and response

#### **Required Information**

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact on users and systems
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: OS, Go version, database versions, etc.
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, provide a minimal PoC
- **Timeline**: Any disclosure timeline requirements

#### **Response Timeline**

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 3-5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: Following responsible disclosure practices

### **Emergency Security Issues**

For critical security vulnerabilities that require immediate attention:

1. **Use Emergency Procedures**: Follow the emergency procedures in [EMERGENCY_PROCEDURES.md](EMERGENCY_PROCEDURES.md)
2. **Direct Contact**: Contact the maintainer through available channels
3. **Emergency PR**: Use `[EMERGENCY]` prefix for urgent security fixes
4. **Immediate Response**: Critical issues will be addressed immediately

- Enterprise-grade security features

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### **Responsible Disclosure**

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Vulnerabilities reported privately
2. **Assessment Period**: Time to assess and develop fixes
3. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Public disclosure after fixes are ready
4. **Credit**: Recognition for responsible disclosure

### **Disclosure Timeline**

- **Critical**: Immediate disclosure after fix
- **High**: Disclosure within 30 days
- **Medium**: Disclosure within 60 days
- **Low**: Disclosure within 90 days

# Emergency Procedures

This document outlines emergency procedures for the reDB Node project during Phase 1 (Single Maintainer) governance.

## Overview

During Phase 1, the project operates under single maintainer governance with basic protection rules. Emergency procedures are designed to allow rapid response to critical issues while maintaining project integrity.

## Emergency Scenarios

### 1. Critical Security Vulnerabilities
**Definition**: Zero-day vulnerabilities, critical CVEs, or security issues that could compromise user data or system integrity.

**Procedure**:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Create emergency branch: `hotfix/critical-security-fix`
   - Implement fix with minimal scope
   - Test thoroughly in isolation

2. **Emergency PR**:
   - Title: `[EMERGENCY] Critical security fix: <description>`
   - Use emergency bypass if needed
   - Merge immediately after maintainer review

3. **Post-Emergency**:
   - Document the vulnerability and fix
   - Update security documentation
   - Consider if governance phase needs adjustment

### 2. Production System Failures
**Definition**: Issues causing service outages, data loss, or critical functionality failures.

**Procedure**:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Assess impact and scope
   - Create emergency branch: `hotfix/production-fix`
   - Implement minimal fix to restore service

2. **Emergency PR**:
   - Title: `[EMERGENCY] Production fix: <description>`
   - Include impact assessment
   - Merge with maintainer approval

3. **Post-Emergency**:
   - Conduct post-mortem analysis
   - Update runbooks and procedures
   - Implement preventive measures

### 3. Dependency Security Issues
**Definition**: Critical vulnerabilities in dependencies that require immediate updates.

**Procedure**:
1. **Assessment**:
   - Evaluate vulnerability severity
   - Check for available patches
   - Assess breaking change risk

2. **Emergency Update**:
   - Create branch: `hotfix/dependency-security-update`
   - Update dependencies with minimal changes
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Emergency PR**:
   - Title: `[EMERGENCY] Dependency security update: <package>`
   - Include vulnerability details
   - Merge after maintainer review

## Emergency Bypass Procedures

### Maintainer Bypass (Phase 1)
During Phase 1, the maintainer can bypass normal protection rules for emergencies:

1. **Direct Push** (for critical fixes only):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   # Make emergency fix
   git commit -m "fix(security): emergency critical vulnerability patch"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Emergency PR Bypass**:
   - Create PR with `[EMERGENCY]` prefix
   - Maintainer can merge immediately
   - Document reason for bypass

### Emergency Branch Pattern
For non-critical but urgent fixes:

```bash
# Create emergency fix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix

# Make the fix
git commit -m "fix: urgent issue resolution"

# Merge directly
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/urgent-fix --no-ff

# Clean up
git branch -d hotfix/urgent-fix
```

## Communication During Emergencies

### Internal Communication
1. **Immediate**: Notify maintainer via GitHub Issues or Discussions
2. **Ongoing**: Update issue with progress and decisions
3. **Resolution**: Document final outcome and lessons learned

### External Communication
1. **Security Issues**: Follow responsible disclosure practices
2. **Service Issues**: Update users through appropriate channels
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation with fixes

## Post-Emergency Procedures

### 1. Documentation
- Document the emergency and response
- Update runbooks and procedures
- Record lessons learned

### 2. Review and Assessment
- Assess if governance procedures need adjustment
- Review if Phase 1 rules are adequate
- Consider if emergency procedures worked as intended

### 3. Prevention
- Implement preventive measures
- Update monitoring and alerting
- Enhance testing procedures

## Phase-Specific Considerations

### Phase 1 (Current): Single Maintainer
- **Advantage**: Rapid decision making
- **Risk**: Single point of failure
- **Mitigation**: Clear procedures and documentation

### Future Phases
As the project grows, emergency procedures will evolve:
- **Phase 2**: Multiple maintainers, shared emergency authority
- **Phase 3**: Emergency response team
- **Phase 4**: Formal incident response procedures

## Emergency Contacts

### Phase 1 Contacts
- **Maintainer**: @tommihip
- **Primary Contact**: GitHub Issues with `[EMERGENCY]` label
- **Backup Contact**: GitHub Discussions

### Escalation Path
1. Create GitHub Issue with `[EMERGENCY]` label
2. Tag maintainer (@tommihip)
3. If no response within 4 hours, use direct communication channels
4. Document all communications for post-emergency review

## Emergency Checklist

### Before Emergency PR
- [ ] Issue is truly critical/urgent
- [ ] Minimal scope fix implemented
- [ ] Basic testing completed
- [ ] Impact assessment documented
- [ ] Emergency bypass justified

### During Emergency PR
- [ ] Use `[EMERGENCY]` prefix in title
- [ ] Include clear description of issue
- [ ] Document impact and urgency
- [ ] Request maintainer review
- [ ] Merge only after maintainer approval

### After Emergency PR
- [ ] Document the emergency
- [ ] Update relevant documentation
- [ ] Conduct post-mortem if needed
- [ ] Implement preventive measures
- [ ] Review governance procedures

## Governance Evolution

Emergency procedures will evolve with the project:

### Phase 1 → Phase 2
- Add multiple maintainer approval for emergencies
- Implement emergency response team
- Add formal incident response procedures

### Phase 2 → Phase 3
- Establish dedicated security team
- Add automated emergency detection
- Implement formal incident management

### Phase 3 → Phase 4
- Enterprise-grade incident response
- 24/7 emergency response capability
- Formal governance committee oversight

**Note**: These procedures are designed for Phase 1 governance. As the project evolves, these procedures will be updated to reflect the current governance phase and community needs.
